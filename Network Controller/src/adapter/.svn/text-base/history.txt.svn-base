// Module Name: ADAPTER
//
// This document describes the major changes, additions and bug fixes made 
// to the AX11000 Firmware between released versions. 
//======================================================================
Version 1.0.5  (2008-06-30)
1. Support a new option that programmer can force the embedded Ethernet PHY to operate in 
   10Mbps half-duplex mode. The EEPROM address 0x01(Flag) BIT-0 must be set to 1.

Version 1.0.4  (2008-06-20)
1. In non-transparent mode, this module will make sure that it has get the ip address from
   DHCP server or by the default setting and has get the gateway address, then sending the
   arp request frame to query the gateway mac address.

Version 1.0.3  (2008-06-04)
1. Added some code to determine whether the Ethernet function is link up or not
   (i.e., Ethernet cable is plugged or not). If Ethernet function is link down,
   the module should drop all transmitted packets.

Version 1.0.2  (2007-06-25)
1. When hardware works with transparent mode, If software should do with DHCP client
   to get a IP address from DHCP server, software must disable hardware IP filter function
   (because IP address has not been set into hardware register at this time).
   So harware set all received packets to non-ip packets, and this new module
   should parse all packets and dispachs them to ip/non-ip packets.

Version 1.0.1  (2007-01-19)
1. Add ETH_SendArpToGateway and ETH_RestartSendArpToGateway subroutines, and listen 
   all arp reply packets. User calls ETH_SendArpToGateway in main routine with a boolean 
   parameter. If the parameter is true, this routine sends arp request continuously
   until eth_GatewayArpStaticFlag is be set to true when receive the arp reply from the
   gateway. If receive the first gateway's arp reply packet, this module calls STOE_AddArpTable
   to add gateway IP address and MAC address into the arp entry as static, and set the
   eth_GatewayArpStaticFlag to true. If the parameter is false, this routine still send
   arp request to gateway even receive the gateway's arp reply.
   User calls ETH_RestartSendArpToGateway after setting a new gateway ip address, so that
   ETH_SendArpToGateway routine can restart sending arp request to gateway.

Version 1.0.0  (2006-10-23)
1. Initial release
