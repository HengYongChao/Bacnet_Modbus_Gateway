This subdirectory includes the source files of AX110xx web server 
and the HTML to C converter utility (mfilesys.exe). This utility just 
provides some basic HTML converter function. You should refer 
to Section 6 of AX110xx Upper Layer Protocol Developer Guide and 
the orginal web_fun.c, filesys.c and filesys.h files that was included 
in the orginal AX110xx sample code to modify the new converted web_fun.c, 
filesys.c and filesys.h files. Now you should compile the new AX110xx 
firmware successfully.

Note: The AX110xx web server sample code is just for your reference.
If you need to implement more complex web server, you might need  
get more information from uIP web site (http://www.sics.se/~adam/uip/) 
or other public Internet web sites.
