uIP is a very small implementation of the TCP/IP stack that is written
by Adam Dunkels <adam@dunkels.com>. More information can be obtained

Note: The tcpip.LIB has been compiled with some parameters that has been
definied in *.h file, so does not try to modify the default value of any
definition in this module.
