//======================================================================
// AX11000 Firmware Revision History
// Module Name: ETHERNET
//
// This document describes the major changes, additions and bug fixes made 
// to the AX11000 Firmware between released versions. 
//======================================================================
Version 1.0.8  (2008-07-17)
1. To fix the issue that after user set the "upgrade" command through web or ASIX Device Finder,
   bootloader upgraded the new run-time code and then executed the new firmware. But driver
   could not get the first ethernet link-up interrupt event.

Version 1.0.7  (2008-07-09)
1. After Ethernet Linking, software total delays about 200m to wait embedded phy stable, and then
   exits the medium-check function.

Version 1.0.6  (2008-06-30)

1. Support a new option that programmer can force the embedded Ethernet PHY to operate in 
   10Mbps half-duplex mode. At this option, software does not set reset, enable and restart
   auto-negotiation bits in PHY register-0. The EEPROM address 0x01(Flag) BIT-0 must be set to 1.

Version 1.0.5  (2008-06-04)

1. Modified the initialization procedure of embedded Ethernet PHY to make sure it could be
   powered up and initialized stably every time.
2. When the Ethernet cable was unplugged and detected by software, the ethernet module shall
   disable the receive operation of Ethernet MAC (by setting SFR MSMR RE bit to 0), then clear
   all the packets in both hardware Ethernet MAC buffer and software RX buffer ring, and finally
   sets Ethernet MAC to enter Reset Mode (by setting SFR RCR SO bit to 0). This procedure could
   avoid storing some broken fragment of a packet in hardware Ethernet MAC buffer during
   Ethernet cable unplug.
3. When software driver detects the Ethernet link up event again, the ethernet module shall
   enable the receive operation of Ethernet MAC (by setting SFR MSMR RE bit to 1), then check
   the link speed of Ethernet PHY (after auto-negotiation) and finally set Ethernet MAC to exit
   Reset Mode (by setting SFR RCR SO bit to 1).

Version 1.0.4  (2007-06-25)

1. Add _nop_ instruction to fix interrupt issue.
2. When hardware works with transparent mode, If software should do with DHCP client
   to get a IP address from DHCP server, software must disable hardware IP filter function
   (because IP address has not been set into hardware register at this time).
   This new module supports both STOE_EnableIpFilter()/STOE_DisableIpFilter() functions,
   so up-layer modules could call the two functions to enable/disable hardware IP filter function.
   The IP filter function default is enable by hardware, so software must disable this function
   before doing with DHCP client function, and after get assigned IP address, driver must disable
   hardware IP filter function immediately. 

Version 1.0.3  (2007-01-18)

1. Add STOE_AddArpTable subroutine. User can call this routine to add static arp entry.

Version 1.0.2  (2006-12-08)

1. Modified phy.c file that local parameter phy_Control was changed from U8_T to U16_T.

Version 1.0.1  (2006-11-08)

1. Change the default setting of receiving buffer from 8k to 6k.
2. Change the default setting of processing transfer packets type from
   STOE_NON_TRANSPARENT_MODE to STOE_TRANSPARENT_MODE.
3. Change the default setting of processing multicast packets from
   MAC_NOT_SUPPORT to MAC_SUPPORT.
4. Add MAC_GetMacAddr() function to support uplayer module to get the MAC address of hardware.
5. Add PHY_WatchDog() function. The main function must call this function per 2 second
   to make sure that phy is working right.

Version 1.0.0  (2006-04-14)

1. Initial release
