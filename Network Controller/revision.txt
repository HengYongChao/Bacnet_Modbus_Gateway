Rev64_1: Created by Evan 2012-03-08, based on Rev63_10 which was created by LHN.
   Add DHCP feature. If set register 106 to 1, the unit will enable DHCP, and the ip address of NC will be assigned by router.

   If clear register 106 to 0, the unit will fix the ip address as 192.168.0.3, it static ip mode.
   In the static ip mode, please set the ip address of your PC to 198.168.0.xxx. And set the gateway of your router to 192.168.0.xxx if there is a router across PC and NC.
